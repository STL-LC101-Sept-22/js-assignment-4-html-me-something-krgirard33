        <h1>Hello, and welcome to Drunk and Clueless in the Kitchen!</h1>

        <p>
          I am not a good cook, but I like to do it. And, like Julia Childs, I
          feel that having some alcohol while cooking makes one more creative.
        </p>

        <p>
          My biggest issue in cooking is all the prep... I am slow and careful
          becuase I have no idea what I am doing, so they say 10 min prep, for
          me it is more like 20.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also bad at judging portions. If I try to cook for 2 I'll make
          enough for 5. I blame this on learning to cook as a bottomless pit
          teenager who then became a grass cutter who was eating 3500+ cals a
          day and not gaining weight.

          I often just see a recipie and say "Hey, that looks good". For example
          I saw a picture of ratatouille, said that looks simple, hit up Amazon,
          ordered a mandoline (Once I spelled it correctly and quit getting
          offered a tiny guitar), and 3 short weeks later I spent way too long
          slicing veggies up. It came out ok, and I said I am never making that
          agin.
        </p>

          Another time I saw something called Hasselback Butternut Squash. No
          idea what it was, so I had to look it up and make it. Butternut
          squash, maple syrup, pecans, & pumpkin spice all roasted in the oven.
          Hasselback is apparently just cutting 95% of the way through something
          so that you have all these little slices about 1/8<sup>th</sup> of an
          inch apart, which lets you get all the other ingredients down in
          there. I figured out it helps if you put something like a rolling pin
          under the section you are working on so it fans out the slices.

          The kids still talk about the time I made grey eggs. I make what I
          call concrete. A ton of things that would be good in an omlet (ham,
          green peppers, mushrooms, onions, baccon bits, etc), with enough
          scrambled eggs to make it all into a solid mass once cooked. This time
          I decided to add a little worcestershire sauce to the eggs. The kids
          took one look at the grey stuff I put on their plates and decided they
          were not hungry. It tasted great.

        />
        <p>
          Sometimes the stuff I make is more "What's in the fridge?", like some
          Napa cabbage, ground beef, carrots, parsnips, garlic, some soy &
          sriracha sauce, for a fast and easy meal.
