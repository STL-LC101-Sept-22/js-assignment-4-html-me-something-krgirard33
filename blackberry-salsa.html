        <h1>Blackberry Chipotle Salsa</h1>
        <p>
          I got this recipie off Seantaclaus, who is a great cook who makes
          amazing food and sometimes writes it down when someone ask how he made
          something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 1) Mix yourself up a margarita. I am fond of blue margaritas, but
          I am not a snob and will drink others. And since 2 of the ingredients
          in the salsa are magarita mix and tequila, it makes it convenient.
          Maybe make a pitcher of margaritas since I am guessing you are
          planning on having others over.
        </p>
        <h3>Gather up the ingredients, and do the prep work</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2/3 bag frozen Blackberrie</li>
          <li>1 1/2 cup Raspberries</li>
          <li>1 can Pineapple niblets/tidbits/whatever, drained</li>
          <li>1 Red Onion minced/chopped small</li>
          <li>1 1/2 Red Bell Pepper chopped</li>
          <li>8 or 9 cloves minced Garlic</li>
          <li>3 Chipotles (it isn't just a resturant)</li>
          <li>2 Tbsp Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar</li>
          <li>2 shots Tequila</li>
          <li>1/3 cup Margarita Mix</li>
          <li>2 Tbsp Lemon Juice</li>
          <li>Various spices if you think it is missing something</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What ta do</h3>
        <p>
          1) Dump the blackberries, raspberries, red onion, 1/2 the can of
          pineapple, garlic and 3 chipotles into the food processor, and run it
          until everything is shredded/minced.
        </p>
        <p>
          2) Pour the mixture into a saucepan over medium heat to try and
          condense the liquid a bit, eventually adding the rest of the
          ingredients in the listed order. Yes, even the remaining 1/2 can of
          pineapple. This is why you got the tiny chunks version.
        </p>
        <p>
          3) Sample it at this point, see if you need to add any spices, like
          maybe some powdered Ancho.
        </p>
        <p>4) Place in the fridge till it is no longer warm.</p>
        <p>
          Now place it in front of people, say <strong>"Bon app&eacute;tit!"</strong>, and
          take a drink of your margarita as you channel your inner Julia Child.
